=head1 NAME

Unicode::BiDiRule - RFC 5893 BiDi Rule

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::BiDiRule qw(check);
  $result = check($string);
  %result = check($string);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Unicode::BiDiRule> performs checking according to BiDi Rule described in
RFC 5983.

Note that the word "UTF-8" in this document is used in its proper meaning.

=head1 Function

=over

=item check ( $string )

Check if a string satisfys BiDi Rule.

Parameters:

=over

=item $string

A string to be checked, Unicode string or bytestring.

Note that bytestring won't be upgraded to Unicode string but will be treated
as UTF-8 sequence.

=back

Returns:

In scalar context:
Direction of string, C<UNKNOWN> (C<0>), C<LTR> or C<RTL>,
if it satisfys the rule.
Otherwise C<undef>.

In array context:
A list of pairs describing detail of result with these keys:

=over

=item C<result>

One of values described in L</Constants>.

=item C<offset>

If the check fails, offset from beginning of string.
If succeeds, length of string.

Offset or length is based on byte for bytestring,
and based on character for Unicode string.

=item C<length>

When the check fails, length of disallowed substring.

Length is based on byte for bytestring,
and based on character for Unicode string.

=item C<ord>

Unicode scalar value of the first character of substring,
when C<length> item is set.

=back

=back

=head2 Constants

=over

=item C<UNKNOWN>

=item C<LTR>

=item C<RTL>

=item C<DISALLOWED>

Possible results of checking.
C<UNKNOWN> indicates that string was empty and its direction was not
determined.

=back

=head2 Exports

None by default.
C<:all> tag exports check() and constants.

=head1 CAVEATS
